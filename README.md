**Movie Recommendation system**

## DAtaset
Movie Recommendation System uses (TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv].

## Methodology
1. Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director,
description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.

2. Use T5-small to use dialogue based recommendation for smaller movie dataset [IN PROGRESS]
